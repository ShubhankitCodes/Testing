# audio/ — Audio In & Out

**Owner: Adithi**  
This README covers Week 1. Refinements (better barge-in, tuning) come later.

## What this folder is

The system's ears and mouth. Two jobs: turn the user's speech into text as they talk 
(speech-to-text), and turn the system's answer back into spoken audio (text-to-speech). 
Plus the ability to stop speaking instantly if the user interrupts.

## Why it matters

This is the front door of the whole system. It is also the highest-risk component in Week 1 
because audio is where the trickiest timing bugs live. Build it carefully and in isolation 
first, and flag early if you get stuck — do not struggle silently.

## Week 1 goal (your deliverable)

1. Real streaming speech-to-text that produces partial guesses every 300–500 ms.
2. Real local text-to-speech that speaks a given sentence.
3. Both working together in a small standalone script (not yet wired into the main 
   pipeline).
4. Every audio event written to the log in the frozen schema format.

**Priority order:** get transcription and speech-out solid first. The interrupt feature 
(barge-in) is important but can slip to Week 2 if time is short — do not let it block the 
core.

## Background: the key ideas

- **Streaming** means producing text *as the person talks*, not after they finish.
- **Partial guesses** are live transcriptions that get revised as more audio arrives (e.g. 
  "I need a rum" becomes "I need a room"). Emitting these every 300–500 ms is the goal.
- **Barge-in** is when the user interrupts while the system is talking. The system must stop 
  speaking within about 100 ms.

## How to start (step by step)

### Step 1 — Speech-to-text in isolation (`stt.py`)

Use `faster-whisper` (a fast, local Whisper implementation). Write a small script that 
takes microphone or audio-file input and prints transcriptions, emitting partial guesses as 
audio streams in. Confirm it revises its guesses as more speech arrives.

### Step 2 — Text-to-speech in isolation (`tts.py`)

Use a local text-to-speech engine such as `piper`. Write a script that takes a sentence and 
speaks it aloud. Confirm it sounds clear.

### Step 3 — Put them together (`audio_loop.py`)

A small standalone loop: you speak, it transcribes (with partials), and it speaks a fixed 
canned reply back. This proves both directions work. Do not connect it to the main pipeline 
yet — that swap happens once the spine is ready.

### Step 4 — Log every audio event

Using the shared log writer (`logging/`), record audio events in the frozen schema:
- `asr_partial` — each live guess (with `text`)
- `asr_final` — the finalized transcription (with `text`)
- `user_end` — when the user is judged to have stopped
- `tts_first_audio` — the moment the first sound of the reply goes out (this is the timing 
  anchor the harness needs)
- `barge_in` — if/when the user interrupts (once that feature exists)

### Step 5 (if time allows) — Barge-in

Add the ability to detect the user speaking while the system is talking, and stop the 
speech output within ~100 ms. If Week 1 is tight, note where you stopped and continue in 
Week 2.

## Not in Week 1

- Wiring into the main pipeline (the integration lead does the swap once the spine exists).
- Echo cancellation tuning, prosody tuning — later.

## Definition of done (Week 1)

Real speech in and real speech out, working in a standalone script, with all audio events 
logged in the frozen schema. Ready to replace the pipeline's audio stubs.

## Coordinate with

The integration lead, who will plug this into the spine once your standalone version works.
