log_writer.py — shared logging helper for the Voice-RAG Controller event log.

Every component (audio, retrieval, llm, controller, ...) writes conversation
events through this module. The exact fields and event types below mirror
eventlog/schema.md (FROZEN v1) — read that file first if you haven't.

# The shared clock
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Schema rule: "Use one monotonic clock for t_ms everywhere." A monotonic
# clock only ever moves forward — unlike the system clock, it can't jump
# backward from an NTP sync or a manual clock change. We capture a single
# reference point (_START_NS) the moment this module is first imported.
# Every event's t_ms afterward is that event's monotonic time minus this
# reference, converted to milliseconds — i.e. "ms since the logger started."
#
# Because _START_NS is a module-level constant, every LogWriter in this
# process (one per conversation, possibly created from different threads —
# audio, retrieval, llm) measures time from the same zero point, so their
# t_ms values land on one shared, comparable timeline. This guarantee only
# holds within a single Python process; if the pipeline ever splits across
# processes, each process would need its own agreed time source.
